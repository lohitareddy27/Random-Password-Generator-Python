# Random-Password-Generator-Python
PyPassword Generator is a simple yet powerful Python-based password generator that creates secure passwords based on user preferences. The user can specify the number of letters, numbers, and symbols they want in their password, and the program generates a strong password with a randomized character order for better security.
Features:

Customizable Password Length: Users can define how many letters, numbers, and symbols to include.
Randomized Order: The final password shuffles all selected characters for added security.
Easy-to-Use: Runs in the command line and takes user input interactively.
Secure & Unpredictable: Utilizes Python's random module for strong password generation.
How It Works:

The program prompts the user to input:
Number of letters
Number of symbols
Number of numbers
The password components are randomly selected from predefined character lists.
The selected characters are shuffled to enhance security.
The final password is displayed.
